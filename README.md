# tf-navmesh
Generated nav meshes for all TF2 maps

Certain maps in TF2 have a nav mesh already pre-baked in their BSP or in tf_misc.vpk, so this repository will only include maps that do not so as not to waste space

Also, it's important to note that I'm lazy so these meshes are not edited or optimized in the slightest. I just generated them with "nav_generate" and that's it. Feel free to edit them yourself if you like
